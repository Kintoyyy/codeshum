# CodeShum

**Project Overview:**

CodeShum is a personal project inspired by the original [CodeChum](https://codechum.com/). Created for fun and as a self-challenge, this project aims to replicate the features and functionality of CodeChum, providing a platform for coding challenges and enhancing my programming skills. This project works in conjunction with the [CodeChum Backend](https://github.com/kintoyyy/codechum-backend) for handling server-side logic and data management.

**Features:**

- **Challenge Library:** Explore a variety of coding challenges similar to those on CodeChum, categorized by difficulty and topic.
- **Code Playground:** Test your coding skills with a sandbox environment for experimenting with algorithms and code snippets.
- **Progress Tracking:** Keep track of your progress and monitor the challenges youâ€™ve solved.
- **Community Interaction:** Engage with others by sharing solutions and discussing coding challenges.

**Technologies Used:**

- Backend: Next.js (frontend) & Express.js (backend)
- Frontend: React, shadcn/ui
- Database: MongoDB
